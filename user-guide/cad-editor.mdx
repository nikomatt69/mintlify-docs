    Adapt the interface to your specific needs:
    
    - **Workspace Layout**: Configure panel arrangement and sizes
    - **Custom Toolbars**: Add frequently used tools
    - **Menus and Palettes**: Organize tools in logical groups
    - **Color Themes**: Choose themes optimized for long work sessions
    - **User Profiles**: Save different configurations for different types of activities
    
    Access customization options from Tools > Preferences > Interface menu.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Templates" icon="file-circle-plus">
    Create and use templates for recurring drawing types:
    
    - **Basic Templates**: For standard projects with default settings
    - **Industry Templates**: Optimized for specific disciplines (mechanical, architectural, etc.)
    - **Company Templates**: With your organization's standards, blocks, and styles
    - **Personal Templates**: Adapted to your specific workflow
    - **Template Library**: Manage and share templates within the team
    
    Save a file as template from File > Save as Template menu.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Frequent Saving" icon="floppy-disk">
    Adopt the habit of regularly saving your work:
    
    - **Incremental Saves**: Create numbered versions to track evolution
    - **Autosave Configuration**: Set short intervals (5-10 minutes)
    - **Save Before Complex Operations**: Create safe restore points
    - **Regular Backups**: Export safety copies to external devices
    - **Save Comments**: Add notes about what was modified
    
    The Ctrl+S (Cmd+S) key combination should become an automatic reflex.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Organizing Models

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Naming Conventions" icon="tag">
    Use descriptive and systematic names:
    
    - **Prefixes for type**: Use prefixes like "ASM_" for assemblies, "PRT_" for parts
    - **Logical Naming**: Include part numbers or project codes
    - **Versioning**: Incorporate version numbers or dates
    - **Brief Descriptions**: Balance brevity and clarity
    - **Consistency**: Follow the same system across all projects
    
    Examples: "PRT_10234_SupportBracePrincipal_v2" or "ASM_TrasmissionePrincipale_2024-03"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hierarchical Structure" icon="diagram-project">
    Organize complex elements into logical subgroups:
    
    - **Functional Components**: Group by function or system
    - **Intermediate Assemblies**: Create for related parts
    - **References**: Use parent-child relationships correctly
    - **Visibility Management**: Organize for easy selective viewing
    - **Modularity**: Design for reuse and maintainability
    
    A good hierarchical structure facilitates navigation and modification of complex projects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Metadata" icon="tags">
    Add descriptive information for easier search:
    
    - **Standard Properties**: Author, date, status, revision
    - **Keywords and Categories**: Keywords for easy search
    - **Technical Information**: Material, production process, tolerances
    - **Usage Notes**: Special instructions or limitations
    - **External References**: Links to specific or related documentation
    
    Metadata makes your models easier to find, understand, and manage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integrated Documentation" icon="book">
    Include notes and references directly in the file:
    
    - **Project Notes**: Explanations of design decisions
    - **Change Log**: Main changes over time
    - **Project Constraints**: Documentation of project criteria
    - **Instructions**: How to use or modify the model
    - **External References**: Links to specific or applicable standards
    
    Integrated documentation ensures that critical information remains with the model.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simplifying Geometry" icon="minimize">
    Reduce complexity when possible:
    
    - **Appropriate Detail**: Use only the necessary level of detail
    - **Feature Suppression**: Temporarily disable unnecessary details
    - **Simplified Representations**: Create lightweight versions for assemblies
    - **Derived Parts**: Use simplified models for reference
    - **Schematic Substitution**: Replace complex components with schematic representations
    
    A simpler model is easier to manipulate and less prone to issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Managing Levels" icon="layer-group">
    Hide unnecessary levels to improve performance:
    
    - **Detail Levels**: Organize elements by importance
    - **Level Freezing**: Make inactive levels unmodifiable
    - **Construction Geometry**: Separate auxiliary geometry
    - **Visibility Overrides**: Configure presets for different activities
    - **Cleaning**: Periodically remove empty or unused levels
    
    Efficient level management improves both performance and visual clarity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selective Visualization" icon="eye">
    Use appropriate visualization modes:
    
    - **Wireframe**: For quick navigation and selection
    - **Shaded Simple**: For general editing
    - **Realistic Rendering**: Only when necessary for evaluations
    - **Environmental Occlusion**: Balancing speed and comprehensibility
    - **Adaptive Visualization**: Automatic adjustment based on actions
    
    Adapting visualization modes can significantly improve performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memory Management" icon="microchip">
    Close unnecessary drawings to free resources:
    
    - **Open File Limitation**: Keep only necessary files open
    - **Cache Cleaning**: Regularly clear temporary cache
    - **Database Optimization**: Periodically compact databases
    - **Resource Monitoring**: Keep an eye on memory usage
    - **Regular Restart**: Restart application during long breaks
    
    Proactive resource management prevents crashes and slowdowns during long sessions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  For complex projects, consider the "top-down" approach: start with a simplified general layout and add details progressively. This keeps the project manageable even in early stages and helps prevent performance issues.
