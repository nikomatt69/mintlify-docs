    - **Complete metadata**: Add information about setup, required tools, etc.
    - **Periodic testing**: Regularly verify backup accessibility
    
    Systematic backups prevent loss of time and knowledge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Incremental Testing" icon="flask">
    Test new programs carefully, gradually increasing speed and depth:
    
    - **Single block**: First execution in single block mode
    - **Reduced speed**: Start with low feed override
    - **Visual verification**: Check first steps carefully
    - **Programmed interruptions**: Insert pauses for inspections
    - **Intermediate measurements**: Verify dimensions during process
    - **Progressive increase**: Gradually increase to full regime
    
    A gradual approach allows intercepting problems before they become critical.

### Productivity

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Machining Templates" icon="copy">
    Create templates for recurring operations:
    
    - **Standard operations**: Save optimized configurations for common operations
    - **Material-specific setup**: Templates dedicated to different materials
    - **Predefined sequences**: Series of pre-ordered operations
    - **Tested parameters**: Values already verified in the field
    - **Integrated documentation**: Notes and explanations included in template
    - **Organized catalog**: Accessible library of templates for different cases
    
    Templates drastically reduce programming time for repetitive operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Automation" icon="robot">
    Automate repetitive sequences:
    
    - **Custom scripts**: Create automations for recurring operations
    - **Feature recognition**: Use automatic geometry recognition
    - **Predefined rules**: Define standard behaviors for common situations
    - **Batch processing**: Process groups of operations simultaneously
    - **Machine cycles**: Leverage machine fixed cycles
    - **Flow integration**: Connect CAD, CAM, and machine seamlessly
    
    Automation improves consistency and reduces programming errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combined Operations" icon="object-ungroup">
    Reduce number of setups by combining operations:
    
    - **Multi-axis machining**: Use 4/5 axes to access multiple faces
    - **Multiple fixtures**: Configure multiple parts simultaneously
    - **Optimized sequences**: Organize to minimize setup changes
    - **Universal tools**: Use versatile tools for different operations
    - **Consolidation**: Combine similar operations when possible
    - **Assisted setup**: Use probes to speed up setup changes
    
    Setup reduction can drastically improve overall productivity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Speed/Quality Balance" icon="scale-balanced">
    Find the right balance between speed and machining quality:
    
    - **Requirements analysis**: Understand real tolerance and finish needs
    - **Differentiated strategies**: Use different approaches for roughing and finishing
    - **Selective finishing**: Apply high quality only where necessary
    - **Progressive testing**: Incrementally verify results
    - **Operator feedback**: Gather input from machine operators
    - **Continuous improvement**: Constantly refine programs
    
    An optimal balance maximizes efficiency while maintaining required quality.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Dedicate time to the programming and simulation phase. Every minute invested in this phase can save many minutes of machine time, reduce scrap, and prevent costly damage. Careful programming is the most profitable investment in the CNC machining process.
