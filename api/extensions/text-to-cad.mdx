# Text-to-CAD Generation

The Text-to-CAD generation system allows you to convert natural language descriptions into 3D CAD models. This functionality is powered by AI text processing and parametric CAD generation.

## How It Works

The Text-to-CAD generation process involves several steps:

1. **Text Processing**: The natural language description is analyzed to extract parameters, constraints, and intent
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Dimensions, materials, and other specifications are identified
3. **Geometric Interpretation**: The system determines what kind of 3D geometry to create
4. **Model Generation**: A parametric 3D model is created based on the interpreted specifications
5. **Extension Enhancement**: Any registered extensions are applied to enhance the model
6. **Export**: The model is exported to the requested file format

## Using the API

To generate a CAD model from text, you can use the `handleCadGenerationRequest` method:

```typescript
const result = await extensionManager.handleCadGenerationRequest({
  textDescription: 'A rectangular box with width 10cm, height 5cm, and depth 8cm',
  format: 'stl', // Supported formats: stl, obj, step, iges, json
  options: {
    resolution: 'high', // Options: low, medium, high
    units: 'mm',        // Options: mm, cm, m, in
    scale: 1.0,         // Scaling factor
    tolerance: 0.01     // Tolerance for curved surfaces
  }
}, user);
```

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| textDescription | string | Natural language description of the model to create |
| format | string | Output file format (stl, obj, step, iges, json) |
| options | object | Additional options for generation and export |

### Response Structure

```typescript
{
  model: {
    id: string,       // Unique identifier for the generated model
    name: string,     // Generated name for the model
    format: string    // Format of the exported file
  },
  file: {
    fileName: string, // Name of the exported file
    format: string,   // Format of the exported file
    data: string,     // Base64-encoded file data
    size: number,     // Size of the file in bytes
    metadata: object  // Additional information about the file
  }
}
```

## Writing Effective Text Descriptions

To get the best results when using the Text-to-CAD system, follow these guidelines:

### Be Specific About Dimensions

Include specific measurements with units:

```
Create a cylinder with a diameter of 30mm and height of 50mm
```

### Specify Shapes Clearly

Reference common geometric shapes:

```
Make a rectangular prism with length 10cm, width 5cm, and height 3cm
```

### Define Relationships

Describe how parts relate to each other:

```
Create a box with a centered cylindrical hole through the top face
```

### Specify Materials

Include material information when relevant:

```
Design a metal bracket with thickness 2mm
```

### Include Purpose

Mentioning the purpose can help with interpretation:

```
Create a mounting bracket for a 24mm diameter pipe
```

## Example Descriptions and Results

Here are some examples of text descriptions and the resulting models:

### Basic Shapes

```
"Create a cube with 10cm sides"
```

Produces a 10cm×10cm×10cm cube.

```
"Make a cylinder with 5cm diameter and 12cm height"
```

Produces a cylinder with the specified dimensions.

### Complex Descriptions

```
"Design a cup with a cylindrical body (8cm diameter, 10cm height) with a handle on the side"
```

Produces a cylindrical cup with a handle.

```
"Create a rectangular box (10cm×5cm×3cm) with rounded corners (1cm radius)"
```

Produces a rounded-corner box with the specified dimensions.

## Extending Text-to-CAD Functionality

You can enhance the Text-to-CAD system by creating custom extensions. For example:

- Add support for specialized shapes or features
- Implement domain-specific interpretation for fields like architecture or mechanical engineering
- Add post-processing steps for optimization or validation

See [Creating Extensions](./creating-extensions.md) for more information.
